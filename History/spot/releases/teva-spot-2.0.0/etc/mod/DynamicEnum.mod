# Version 2.2

# This is a second model for sensor placement in water networks.  We wish to 
# decouple sensor placement from assumptions of network flow. We are minimizing the
# (expected) consumption of contaminants as a surrogate for population exposure
# (in this model, it's difficult to get the necessary population data).
# A detailed description will appear in "A General Integer Programming Based Framework for
# Sensor Placement in Municipal Water Networks", at the Symposium on Water Distribution Systems
# Analysis (Salt Lake City, UT, June 2004).
#
# I'm starting with the old EWRI 2003 model since we should have graph .dat files to conform
# to this.
#
# For all sets that are just consecutive sets of integers, we keep flexibility 
# in setting the interval start.  This can be useful when interfacing to other 
# codes and people.
