TEVA-SPOT Toolkit 
========================

The Threat Ensemble Vulnerability Assessment and Sensor
Placement Optimization Tool (TEVA-SPOT) has been developed by the
U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Sandia National Laboratories,
Argonne National Laboratory, and the University of Cincinnati.  TEVA-SPOT
allows a user to specify a wide range of modeling inputs and performance
objectives for contamination warning system design. Further, TEVA-SPOT
supports a flexible decision framework for sensor placement that involves
two major steps: a modeling process and a decision-making process.
The modeling process includes (1) describing sensor characteristics,
(2) defining the design basis threat, (3) selecting impact measures
for the CWS, (4) planning utility response to sensor detection, and (5)
identifying feasible sensor locations.

The capabilities of TEVA-SPOT can be accessed either with a GUI or from
command-line tools. This software is the TEVA-SPOT Toolkit, which contains
these command-line tools. The TEVA-SPOT Toolkit can be used within either
a MS Windows DOS shell or any standard Unix shell (e.g. the Bash shell).

TEVA-SPOT was developed between 2005 and 2011. The repository is no longer under active 
development.  Version 2.5.2 is the final release. Related projects include:
